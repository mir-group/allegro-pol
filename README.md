# allegro-pol

`allegro-pol` is an extension package of the `nequip` framework that adapts the Allegro architecture (another `nequip` extension package) for the prediction of the electric response of materials (polarization, Born charges, polarizability) in addition to energy and forces within a single ML model.
The ideas are described in [in this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17207).

## Installation

This installation requires `nequip==0.6.2` and `nequip-allegro==0.3.0`, which will automatically be installed with `allegro-pol`.

It is strongly recommended to create a fresh virtual environment. For example,
```
conda create -n allegro-pol python=3.11
conda activate allegro-pol
```

It may be advisable to install an older version of PyTorch (e.g. PyTorch 1.11).

Then, install `allegro-pol`, which will install all essential dependencies.
```
git clone https://github.com/mir-group/allegro-pol.git
cd allegro-pol
pip install -e .
```

Users may wish to install additional dependencies such as the Weights and Biases package for logging.
```
pip install wandb
```

## Example

BaTiO3 data and an associated config file are provided for training, which is all based on the `nequip` framework with minor extensions.
The data is located at `data/BaTiO3.xyz` and the example config is located at `configs/BaTiO3.yaml`.
```
nequip-train configs/BaTiO3.yaml
```

## Pre- and Post-Processing Scripts

Pre- and post-processing scripts can be found in `scripts`, along with a tutorial on how to use them.
