## Parity Plot

This script generates parity plots corresponding to two sets of extxyz files. This is useful for:

- Checking the accuracy of the ML model.
- Identifying potential frames to exclude from the training set by including them in the list `exclude_frames` in `parse_QE.py`.

Additional details are provided in the header of `parse_QE.py`.

We provide examples for SiO₂ and BaTiO₃.
