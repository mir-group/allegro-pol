## Ferroelectric Dipoles Perovskite Structure

This scripts determines the ferroelectric dipoles of a orthorombic perovskite structure given a trajectory extxyz file containing Born charges.

We provide the example of 3 frames taken during the ferroelectric switching of the 1080-atom supercell of tetragonal BaTiO3. The full trajectory can be found on the Materials Cloud folder related to this work.
