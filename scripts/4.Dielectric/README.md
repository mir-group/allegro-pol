## Dielectric constant

This script parses the QuantumEspresso and LAMMPS output files from a structural relaxation in the presence of an electric field and calculates the dielectric constant throughout the relaxation process. The script works only for orthorhombic cells; consider generalizing it if needed.

We provide an example of the dielectric constant in SiOâ‚‚.
