## Ferroelectric Hysteresis

This script determines the ferroelectric hysteresis from MLMD at fixed temperature and fixed volume, performed with the Allegro-pol model.
When provided with multiple datafiles for statistics, the script averages polarization values across all trajectories. 

We provide an example of an MD simulation of BaTiOâ‚ƒ (8640 atoms) at 300 K under a sinusoidal electric field with a period of 200 ps.
